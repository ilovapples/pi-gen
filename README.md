You're going to have to install the GMP library, so this program can probably only be compiled on Linux/WSL. 
You are, however, free to try to figure out how to get GMP working on Windows (make sure to post an issue or email me if you end up figuring it out) and compile the code on Windows. Other than the dependency on GMP, it shouldn't have any platform-specific dependencies.

A warning: the code is probably not well organized at all, since I'm still an amateur programmer.

Have a great day.
